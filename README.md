A Discord Bot Write for my discord server,feel free to use.

### V2 is developing ......
Due to heroku is not free anymore, I want to rewrite the bot , to make this bot more

- [ ] Lightweight
- [ ] Readable
- [ ] Easy to configure

The new code will develop at branch ``v2`` , and branch ``main`` will be merged when ``v2`` is ready.

# What to do by first place.
- [x] Remove Unused Library and Code.
- [ ] Rewrite Voice Auto Crate Function.
- [ ] Make Code More Readable.
- [ ] Easier To Develop.

# What's Major Change
- Use yaml file to configure, instead of environment variable.
- Remove Music support due to limit functionality (I want to use lavalink as backend if I have time to implement), and arknights support due to data not up-to-date.
- Use Hibernate instead of Exposed Framework (Need to implement).
